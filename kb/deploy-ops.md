# Knowledge base — deploy-ops lane

Sourced from movate-cli docs, command `--help` output, and Bicep infra
files. Edit this file freely; run `python scripts/build_prompts.py`
to rebuild `agents/expert-deploy-ops/prompt.md`.

## movate doctor — environment + Azure preflight

`movate doctor` runs local checks: Python version, required +
optional deps, provider API keys, tracing env vars, resolved tracer,
storage path, pricing table, `movate.yaml` presence.

Pass `--target <name>` for an Azure preflight that walks:
1. `az login` status
2. Subscription accessibility
3. Resource group accessibility
4. ACR (registry) accessibility
5. Container Apps (api + worker) presence + health
6. `GET /healthz` against the deployed API

Use this when `movate deploy` is failing — the earliest broken link
is where to focus.

## Deployment targets — movate config

A "target" is a registered deployed runtime. Commands:

```bash
# Add a target
movate config add-target dev \
    --url https://movate-dev-api.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io \
    --key-env MOVATE_DEV_KEY \
    --azure-subscription <sub-id> \
    --azure-resource-group movate-dev-rg \
    --azure-acr movatedevacr \
    --azure-env dev \
    --set-active

movate config list-targets       # show all registered
movate config current            # show active
movate config use-target staging # switch active
movate config remove-target old  # unregister
```

API keys are read from env vars (`--key-env MOVATE_DEV_KEY` reads
`$MOVATE_DEV_KEY`) so they never land in `~/.movate/config.yaml`.

## Azure infrastructure — Bicep

`infra/azure/main.bicep` provisions per environment:
- Container Registry (ACR) for the runtime image
- Postgres Flexible Server for storage
- Key Vault for provider API keys + DB password
- Container Apps Environment + 2 apps: api (`movate serve`) and worker (`movate worker`)
- Log Analytics workspace

Bootstrap with `scripts/azure-bootstrap.sh <env>` — creates the
resource group + service principal + federated OIDC credential for
GitHub Actions.

## movate deploy — build image + roll out

`movate deploy --target <name>` does:
1. Build the Docker image
2. Push to the target's ACR
3. Update both Container Apps (api + worker) to the new image
4. Wait for the rollout, then poll `/healthz` until green

Idempotent — run after any code change to push it out.

## movate submit — queue jobs against a deployed runtime

`movate submit <agent-name> '<json-input>' --target <name>` queues a
job at the deployed API. Returns `{job_id, status}` immediately
(fire-and-forget). Pass `--wait` to block until the job hits a
terminal state (success / error / safety_blocked).

The deployed runtime scans `agents/` at startup and registers each
agent.yaml. Agents are referenced by their `name` field, not the
directory path.

## movate jobs — monitor queue

```bash
movate jobs list --target dev --limit 20          # recent
movate jobs list --status running                  # filter by status
movate jobs list --agent expert-scaffold           # filter by agent
movate jobs show <job-id>                          # single job detail
```

## Notifications

The runtime supports fan-out to email (Postmark/SendGrid), SMS
(Azure Communication Services), and Telegram via a MultiDispatcher.
Configure per-tenant in `tenants` table. Each terminal job triggers
a notification.

Telegram setup is the cheapest: register a bot via @BotFather, set
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` env vars on the worker.
Free, no carrier regulatory tax, cross-platform.

## CI / CD

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on push to `release/<env>`
branches. Uses OIDC federated credentials (no long-lived secrets)
to log into Azure, then runs `movate deploy --target <env>`.

`.github/workflows/agents.yml` runs `movate validate` + `movate eval`
on every PR — catches regressions before merge.
